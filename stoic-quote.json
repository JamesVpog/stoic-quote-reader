{"quote": "The mind should not be kept continuously at the same pitch of concentration, but given amusing diversions\u2026 Our minds must relax: they will rise better and keener after a rest. Just as you must not force fertile farmland, as uninterrupted productivity will soon exhaust it, so constant effort will sap our mental vigor, while a short period of rest and relaxation will restore our powers.", "author": "Seneca", "last_dt": "2024-09-30T03:09:28.072350"}
